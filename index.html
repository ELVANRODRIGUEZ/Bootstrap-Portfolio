                    Architect with over 12 years of experience in design project, construction planning
                    and construction managing fields. 
                    <br>
                    Problem solving oriented personality and so devoted to detail care. Curious by nature 
                    about the scientific but also artistic context of my field. Now a days, the former has
                    led me to embark on the Programming World in order to expand my administration capabilities
                    by building remote distribuited and interface friendly environments our working teams can 
                    interact from.
                    <br>
                    The attention to aesthetis and my passion for graphical arts, digital painting in 
                    particular, forces me to always consider the expectator experience, which of course
                    I have as one of the main guide lines when designing information exchange formats for 
                    managing processes. In other words, I always try to merge form and function when 
                    building not just architerctural solutions, but also collaborative managing ones.
